# freeAIPhotoGenerator
## Overview
Super simple to use, a project I created for myself to utilize OpenAI's API Key. All OpenAI's users are given $5 worth of free usage from their image API!
To use just click the website I made hosted by GitHub pages and insert your OpenAI API Key(Looks something like this: sk-insertrandomgeneratedkey)
My motivation for this project was my interest in AI, more specifically image generation. Currently, there isn't support for DALL.E for free from their hosted website.
It's 115 credit for $15 but this workaround allows me to play around with image generation given the $5 free trial!
